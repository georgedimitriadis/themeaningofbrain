    """
    Generate positions (x, y coordinates) for each spike on the probe. This function assumes that the spikes were
    generated with the kilosort algorithm so the base_folder holds all the necessary .npy arrays.
    In order for this function to find which channels are the most relevant in each spike it looks into the spike's
    assigned template (a channels x time points array in spike_templates.npy). It then find the minimum points of all
    channels, takes their median and their standard deviation and for each channel creates the difference between the
    minimum and the median. Finally it demarcates the relevant to the template channels by keeping the ones whose
    difference is larger than a number of times (threshold) over the standard deviation.
    It then picks the relevant channels of the spike's raw data, finds the differences between the minimum value
    and the channel's time series median value (over time), orders the channels according to these differences and
    assigns weights between 0 and 1 (0 for a difference of 0, 1 for a maximum difference).
    It finally finds the x, y positions of the selected channels and adds to the position of the largest difference
    channel the weighted average positions of the remaining selected channels

    used_spikes_indices : array of int

    Define the two spikes-features matrices that are going to be compared by the generate_probe_positions_of_spikes()
    function to find the distances of all the spikes of the first matrix to all the spikes of the second.
    Each spike needs to have its distances found with a number of spikes that are probe_distance_threshold closer to it
    on the spike_probe_distances_sorted array. So this function goes through the spikes starting at index starting_index
    and checks what is the index of the final spike each one of these spikes should have its distance calculated with.
    As it moves down the indices of the sorted array it defines the last index of the first matrix as the current
    index it is on and the last index of the second array as the index of the spike that is just under
    probe_distance_threshold away on the probe to the last spike on the first array.
    Once the number of spikes accumulated in the first matrix times the number of spikes on the second surpasses the
    number of elements the GPU can hold in memory it returns the final_index_of_first_array and the
    final_index_of_second_array indices that define the two matrices to be distance compared to each other.
    Those matrices should have the spikes from starting_index to final_index_of_first_array for the first one and from
    starting_index to final_index_of_second_array for the second one.
